Python typing stub files for the panflute package
=================================================

Add this directory to PYTHONPATH when you run a type checker like
[mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/) to type check your code calling
[panflute](https://scorreia.com/software/panflute/).

Mypy (and others) will use the module `panflute-stubs` in this directory as type hints
for the Python panflute package.

As of Sept 2025 these stub files do not yet have most of the classes and methods of
panflute typed. Pull requests welcome.
